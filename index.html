                    <p>Hi! I am a PhD student in Education Policy at the University of Virginia. My research interests are in teacher labor markets and evaluating education policies in low- and middle-income countries. Prior to starting a PhD, I worked at the Indeed Hiring Lab, J-PAL, Mais Caminhos, MDRC, and NERA Economic Consulting.</p>

                    <h4>Abstract</h4>
                    <p>Heightened concerns about the health of the teaching profession highlight the importance of studying the early teacher pipeline. This exploratory, descriptive article examines preservice teachers' expressed motivation for pursuing a teaching career. Using data from a large teacher education program in Texas, we use a natural language processing algorithm to categorize into topical groups roughly 2,800 essay responses to the prompt, "Explain why you decided to become a teacher." We identify 10 topics that largely reflect altruistic and intrinsic (although not extrinsic) reasons for teaching. The frequency of topics varied substantially by preservice teacher gender, race/ethnicity, and certification area. Intrinsic enjoyment of teaching and experiences with adversity predicted higher clinical teaching performance and lower attrition as a full-time teacher.</p>

                <div class="work-abstract">
                    <h4>Abstract</h4>
                    <p>Teacher shortages in hard to staff subjects are a persistent issue in the United States. This study examines the Bilingual Education Program (BEP), which was established by the Texas State Legislature in 2003 to provide scholarships to incentivize pre-service teachers (PSTs) to obtain Bilingual Educator, English as a Second Language (ESL), or Spanish certificates. In this project, I will decribe which PSTs take advantage of the BEP's funding. I also aim to identify the causal impact of the program on scholarship aid received and whether the program increased the probability that eligible PSTs at participating institutions sat for and passed exams that would earn them certifications in the areas targeted by the BEP. Findings will inform our understanding of which PSTs take advantage of scholarship opportunities and the potential for targeted, unconditional scholarships to alleviate teacher shortages in high needs subjects.</p>

                    <h4>Abstract</h4>
                    <p>While significant attention has been devoted to the health of children under five, older children's health needs remain under-recognized. In Zambia, where malaria prevalence is highest among children aged 5-17, school-age children face high morbidity rates, yet they have limited access to prevention and treatment. Challenges such as fewer bednet use and delays in seeking care exacerbate their health risks, negatively impacting education through high absenteeism and lower cognitive abilities. This study evaluates a program that utilizes schools as a platform for delivering preventive and curative healthcare services to children above five in Zambia. Since 2015, the NGO Healthy Learners has partnered with the Zambian government to implement a School Health Program (SHP), which trains teachers as community health workers and equips schools with health rooms. The program offers diagnosis, treatment, and health education, using schools as entry points into the healthcare system. In contrast to limited school health programs, the SHP provides both preventive and curative care, leveraging resources from the entire school community. The study uses a cluster-randomized controlled trial involving 225 schools, divided into three groups: a control group, a full SHP group, and a group receiving only mass drug administration for benchmarking. This research explores five questions, focusing on the implementation, impact, added value, indirect effects, and long-term implications of the SHP for human capital development. The findings aim to assess the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of a comprehensive school health model in improving health and educational outcomes.</p>
